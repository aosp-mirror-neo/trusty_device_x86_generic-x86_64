# overwrite list of TAs
#

# the test-vm does not include any TAs by default
# (except for the test TAs that are included by virt-test-inc.mk)
#
# tests in Trusty are mostly declared as TRUSTY_LOADABLE_USER_TESTS,
# they also are included by default as builtin apps
# (unless the top-level makefile initializes TRUSTY_BUILTIN_USER_TESTS,
#  see documentation in trusty/kernel/app/trusty/user-tasks.mk)
#
# for virt payload, loadable TAs are generally not applicable
# (apploader interface is not a stable ABI yet).
# So apploader should generally be disabled.
#
# the Trusty build system however makes it complicated to disable
# apploader service while still declaring tests as loadable.
# as a short-term workaround, the test-vm will include apploader service
# TODO(b/) evolve `trusty/kernel/app/trusty/user-tasks.mk` to support
# disabling apploader service and rebalancing loadable test as builtin tests
